# AuthPrac

## Authentication Flow with JWT

## Overview

This application is a simple authentication system built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It provides user registration and login functionalities with a planned integration of JSON Web Token (JWT) for enhanced security.

## MERN Stack

This application is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.

- **MongoDB:** Database for storing user information and other data.
- **Express.js:** Backend framework for handling server-side logic and routing.
- **React:** Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js:** Runtime for executing server-side JavaScript.

## Authentication Flow

Explain the authentication flow used in your application, focusing on the JWT aspect.

1. **Registration:** Users can register for an account, and their credentials are securely stored in the database.

2. **Login:** Upon login, the server generates a JWT token, which is sent to the client.

3. **Token Storage:** The client stores the JWT token securely (e.g., in a cookie or local storage).

4. **Authenticated Requests:** Subsequent requests from the client include the JWT token in the headers for authentication.

## JWT Implementation

JWT authentication is pending and will be implemented in a future update. This will enhance security and enable additional features.
